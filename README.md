## Questions:

- Which time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) should be analyzed?
- Do we need to compare performance by state, region, or location?

- Who are the top customers, and how much do they contribute to revenue?
- What payment methods are most preferred by customers?
- Are there seasonal or monthly trends in profit and sales?
- Do we need to highlight high-performing and low-performing months or products?
- Should filters (e.g., state, category, time period) be included for deeper analysis?
